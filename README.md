Something like: "Neon underwater civilization", try to keep the entries under 10 words in length. 
The JSON file should be in the format of { "topics": [ ] }
```

## Transpiling to Native JavaScript

While Bun is gaining popularity, not all hosting providers support it yet. Don't worry though ‚Äì you can easily convert your Bun project to pure JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with virtually any hosting environment.

### How to Transpile

1. Run the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   bun run build
   ```

2. This will generate a `dist` directory containing:
   - A comprehensive JavaScript file
   - The necessary JSON file(s)

You can now deploy these files to any hosting provider that supports Node.js, which is nearly universal among web hosting services.

### Convenience for Users

**Note:** To save you time and effort, I've included a pre-built pure JavaScript version in the releases section of this repository. You can download and use this version directly if you prefer not to run the build process yourself.

By transpiling to native JavaScript, you're ensuring maximum compatibility while still leveraging Bun's excellent development experience. It's the best of both worlds!

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript / TypeScript runtime.
