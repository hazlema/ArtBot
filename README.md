## Customizing Topics

To add or modify contest topics:

1. Open `src/projects.json`
2. Edit the JSON array of topics.
3. Save the file and restart the bot.

Note: If you customize topics, consider disabling the AI module.

### Generating New Topics

Use your favorite LLM with a prompt like:
```
Create a JSON file with 100 entries for digital art topics. 
Format: { "topics": [ "Neon underwater civilization", ... ] }
Keep entries under 10 words in length.
```

### AI-Generated Topics

- When AI topic generation is enabled, the bot uses the following prompt to generate new topics:
- All you have to do to enable this feature is [add the API key for Anthropic](#setup-and-configuration) to the **src/.env** file.

```
Can you create a json file with 10 entries, these entries should be text fields
and contain a digital art topic. Something like: Neon underwater civilization,
impressionistic painting of woman eating an apple, or cartoon of a mouse being
mischievous try to keep the entries under 10 words in length. And please do not
use any of the suggested topics. randomize as much as possible.
```

This ensures a wide variety of unique and creative topics for your art contests.
